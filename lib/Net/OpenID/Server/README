OpenID for every perl user made easy

Nossa makes almost any of your possessed hosting to be the location for your
own OpenID Server in easy install-and-go way.

Nossa is dedicated for fast installation of your own OpenID 'Server' on a
CGI/FCGI::Spawn - enabled hosting. There is a lot of tweaks for common needs
known as: your own identity source to be pluggable with Config.pm, your own
design for user setup pages, location of your CGI::Session storage, your SRE
information, redirect to your HTTPS server for setup, etc.
